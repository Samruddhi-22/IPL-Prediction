## Overview



The IPL First Innings Score Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts the final score of the first innings in Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. Using historical match data from 2008 to 2017, the project employs regression models to forecast scores based on features like batting/bowling teams, overs, runs, wickets, and recent performance (last 5 overs). The best-performing model, Linear Regression, achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ~12 runs, demonstrating reliable predictions for cricket analytics.

This project is ideal for data science enthusiasts, sports analytics researchers, and developers interested in machine learning and predictive modeling.
